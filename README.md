<br/>
Initially created in spring 2018 this website is currently on its 3rd design iteration. It is built in `vanilla javascript ES6` and is hosted on github pages. It is designed to be lightweight and easily changed.
<br/>
<br/>
It is on the roadmap to port it over to `react.js` or `vue.js` in the near future.

# Vue April 2020 roadmap
This website is going to be migrated to `vue` in April 2020.\
It is going to be deployed using `gh-pages` as the current setup is, but will require an pipeline setup.
