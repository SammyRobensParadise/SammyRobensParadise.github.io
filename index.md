# Welcome to the Wiki

This is a wiki of various projects, portfolios and things that I have worked on over the years. It can be thought of as the _kitchen sink_ of things

## Select Projects

A select set of high touchpoint projects. A full list of software projects/repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise?tab=repositories).

- **[Portfolio](https://sammy.world) üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è** $-$ My latest portfolio build with `Next.js` featuring my latest work, some funky `three.js` and more!
- **[Github Contributions Counter](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/github-contributions-counter) üìä** $-$ A simple Javascript API that will return the public Github contributions history for a user based on a universal function, It can run either browser, or server-side and is available via [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-contributions-counter) as `npm i github-contributions-counter` or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/package/github-contribution-counter) as `yarn add github-contributions-counter`. Don't forget to leave a ‚≠êÔ∏è.
- **[React Interactive Blob](https://sammyrobensparadise.github.io/react-interactive-blob/?path=/story/blob--blob)üîµ** $-$ A React Interactive Blob is an interactive and customizable blob component for react applications. It is built in TypeScript. It can be used just like any other React JSX Component. Drop a ‚≠êÔ∏è on [GitHub](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/react-interactive-blob) and open a pull request to improve the physics!
- **[Code Your Resume](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/code-your-resume) üìÑ** $-$ Finally! A way to write your resume using HTML and CSS, including any CSS library you want! This is still work-in-progress, but gone are the days of formatting your resume with fickle word processors!
- **[Spicy Library](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/spicy-library) üìï** $-$ A template repository to get the creation of a React component library up and running in no-time with `Yarn 2`.
- **[CORS Server](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/cors-server) üçõ** $-$ A NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request. Helpful if you need to use a proxy to perform actions such as web scraping!
- **[Email Resumes](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/email-resumes) üíå** $-$ Currently a `Python` script to do an email blast matching student for resume critique sessions! It is currently in the process of being made into an application (so I don't have to run the script anymore)
- **[The 'Ol Website](https://website-2020-host.web.app/) üï∏Ô∏è** $-$ Old website. This project is no longer maintained or is being updated, but is fun to look at! You can learn about the design process [here](https://website-2020-host.web.app/this-website).
- **[Intensif-Eye](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/dubhacks-19) üëÄ** $-$ Hackathon Project! Wohoo! _Intensif-eye_ (app) allows users to take images of text or hand writing and using Google‚Äôs vision AI API, extracts the text from the image that can be rendered to a screen. My team and I saw this incredible potential to use this powerful technology to allow people who may be visually impaired in some way to access information quickly without the use of glasses or other technology. We did this by extracting text from images and presenting it to users in a high contrast, and accessible fashion.
- **[Verify](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/verify) üõ°Ô∏è** $-$ (In Progress and-somewhat-on-hold) React Native application that lets users check the authenticity of social media content using image recognition to extract text from images on social media, and conduct un-bias searches on the content to verify it's authenticity and accuracy. The app is aimed at combating misinformation and disinformation.

## University Projects

- **[SYDE 556 Simulating Neurobiological Systems](https://sammyrobensparadise.github.io/neurobiological-simulation/) üß†** $-$ Assignments relating to the simulation of neurobiological systems using spiking neural networks. Topics covered include: single neuron function, neural coding, neural dynamics, attractor networks, learning, statistical inference, locomotion, working memory, spacial semantic pointers (SSPs), semantic pointer architecture (SPA), building large-scale brain models, delay networks, Basal Ganglia (BG) Models, etc
- **[SYDE 411 Numerical Optimization](https://sammyrobensparadise.github.io/SYDE-411/) ‚ûï** $-$ Linear programming project solving optimal solution the infamous generalized _traveling salesman problem_ known as the [Vehicle Routing Problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/vehicle-routing-problem). Code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/SYDE-411)
- **[SYDE 362 Engine Signature Machine Learning Prediction](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/engine-signature) üöí** $-$ SYDE 362 Machine Learning Project. It consists of an application designed to detect, and notify a potential worker of a failure or problem with a particular engine based on a trained neural network (using labeled data) based on the audio signature of the engine. Projects leverages `SuperCollider`, and `Next.js`.
- **[SYDE 312 Linear Algebra](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/SYDE-312) „Ä∞Ô∏è** $-$ There is no shortage of applications of linear algebra in the field of digital image handling. Applying fundamental concepts of linear algebra, we can extract insightful information about digital information otherwise unattainable by the human eye. The fitted linear color gradient o f an image is no exception. This project applies a series of linear transformations and least squares fitting to obtain the color gradient of an $n √ó m$ pixel JPEG RGB digital image. You can [read the report here](https://sammyrobensparadise.github.io/SYDE-312/report/report.pdf)
- **[SYDE 572 Pattern Recognition Labs](https://github.com/SammyRobensParadise/SYDE-572) ü´•** $-$ SYDE 572 Pattern Recognition Lab Assignments. Assignments consisted of theories of neural networks, pattern recognition strategies and so-on
